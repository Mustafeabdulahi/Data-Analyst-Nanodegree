# Wrangle and Analyze

The primary objective of this project was to learn the data wrangling process of gathering, assessing, and cleaning data and learn how to use Python to wrangle data programmatically and prepare it for analysis.

# WeRateDogs
In this projec I worked with a tweet archive data called WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates peopleâ€™s dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10
including user ratings and revenue. I collected the data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats including provided csv and Json ontained from Tweeter API and I assessed its quality,tidiness, then clean it.

## Required libraries

```python
* pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Tweepy
* Seaborn
* csv
* Json
```
