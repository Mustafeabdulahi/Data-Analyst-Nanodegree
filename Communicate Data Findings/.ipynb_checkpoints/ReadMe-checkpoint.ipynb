    "The project two parts: has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process.\n",

    "# Part I, Exploratory data visualization\n",
    "I used Python visualization libraries to explore the dataset and understand its features and relationships between variables by creating plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Part II, Explanatory data visualization \n",
    "I Created a short presentation that demonstrates the relationships between the different features in the dataset by transforming my exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations of.\n",
