# Communicate Data Finding

Objective of this project was to learn data visualization principles using python visualization tools and apply it to our data Analysis process. 


The project two parts: has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process.

# Part I, Exploratory data visualization
I used Python visualization libraries to explore the dataset and understand its features and relationships between variables by creating plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables.

# Part II, Explanatory data visualization 
I Created a short presentation that demonstrates the relationships between the different features in the dataset by transforming my exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations of.


# Ford GoBike System Data: 
Is the data is the data I used in this project. The dataset contains information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.

## Required libraries

```Python
* NumPy
* pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
```
    

# Skills Learned
- Supplement statistics with visualizations to build understanding of data.
- How to select appropriate plots, limits, transformations, and aesthetics to explore a dataset, allowing you to understand distributions of variables and relationships between features.
- Use design principles to create effective visualizations for communicating findings to an audience.
