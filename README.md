# Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree
I took a part of the Udacity Data Analyst program (2022), and documented my projects in this Repo which contains the projects I did in the course. In these course, I worked with messy, complex datasets and learned how to Manipulate and prepare datasets for analysis, and create visualizations for data exploration and gained skills to tell a story with data.
